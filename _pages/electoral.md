The Electoral Working Group is organizing to focus on regional outreach, coalition building, and electoral impact. 

The Electoral working group is looking for people willing to step up in their community by setting up a local chapter. The relationship between the working groups and local chapters will be decentralized. Each local chapter will have the freedom to work on projects that are needed based on their communities. The Electoral Group, however, will direct the local chapters on county/regional projects. 

The objectives of the local chapter are again to do projects in their communities while also establishing an identity. Democrats have shown time and time again that they are incapable of solving our right-wing problems. Building an identity is needed when growing political power. Using that political power to push our people into positions of power to better our communities 

Email or message the chapter (or Miguel, directly) via Signal or Discord to get plugged in or attend a general interest meeting.
