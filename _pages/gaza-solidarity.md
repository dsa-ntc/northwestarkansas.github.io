The Gaza Solidarity working group has been working with the amazing people at Friends of Palestine - NWA and helping to support the cause through their actions! 

The Friends of Palestine - NWA have the knowledge base for every part of the genocide being committed in Palestine. Many community members that are involved with Friends of Palestine have been personally affected or their families have been affected by the genocide in Gaza.

The Northwest Arkansas DSA puts their full support behind Friends of Palestine - NWA and the word that they are spreading about the ongoing genocide and oppression faced by Palestinians.

Please direct any action or monetary support for Palestine to the Friends of Palestine - NWA [here!](https://www.facebook.com/p/Friends-of-Palestine-NWA-61555082533749/)
