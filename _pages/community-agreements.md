Rather than creating a set of rules that support a good democratic environment only in the present, the NWA chapter of the DSA asks: **“What kinds of rules and norms will prepare us to create the permanent democratic culture of the future?”** Using this question to shape our praxis, we make the following agreements to our community:

#### Anti-Capitalism Requires Anti-Racism

We recognize that capitalism and racism are inherently linked, and we commit to dismantling both. We acknowledge that people of color and Indigenous people are disproportionately harmed by capitalism, and we commit to centering and amplifying their voices. This means actively listening, engaging in collective learning, and ensuring our organizing prioritizes their experiences and leadership.

#### We Make More Space Than We Take

We listen actively rather than simply waiting to speak. Before contributing, we use the acronym WAIT ("Why Am I Talking?") to check that we aren’t dominating discussion, that we are prioritizing voices that have been historically excluded, and that our point hasn’t already been made. We also implement progressive stack facilitation and intentional moderation to ensure inclusive participation.

#### We Prioritize Accessibility

We strive to make our spaces inclusive for people of all abilities, backgrounds, and circumstances. This includes, but is not limited to:

- Speaking slowly, clearly, and loudly enough for those participating online and for those who are hard of hearing

- Taking COVID precautions, including masking and accommodations for those at increased risk or caring for vulnerable people

- Offering both in-person and virtual options for participation

- Keeping written and audio records of proceedings for those who are absent or have processing or executive functioning challenges

#### We Assume Good Faith While Practicing Collective Accountability

We recognize that healthy political organizing requires both trust and accountability. We assume that fellow comrades act in good faith, while also committing to addressing harm when it occurs. We hold ourselves and one another accountable through restorative and transformative approaches, ensuring that mistakes are acknowledged, repaired, and used as opportunities for learning and growth.

By committing to these principles, we build the foundation for a **democratic, anti-racist, and accessible** socialist movement that will last beyond the present moment.
