## The Illusion of Choice: How Name-Calling Replaces Real Debate

Something peculiar happens when you step outside the narrow boundaries of acceptable political thought in America. The moment you question both parties, or suggest that maybe, just maybe, our problems run deeper than choosing between red and blue, the labels start flying. "Liberal\!" "Fascist\!" "Nazi\!" "Commie\!" These words get thrown around like confetti, but they've been stripped of any real meaning. They're not descriptions anymore, they're weapons designed to end conversations before they begin.

### The Purity Tests on Both Sides

Look closely at both progressive and conservative camps, and you'll notice something interesting: they both demand absolute loyalty to their worldview, but neither worldview actually threatens the people who own everything.

[Progressive liberals](https://jacobin.com/2025/01/elite-identity-politics-professional-class) have turned politics into a moral purity contest. They speak passionately about inclusion, representation, and equity, all important things, but notice how these conversations rarely touch the fundamental question of “[who owns what](https://youtu.be/5eGVY87EAtI?si=7DvqCu4E78Z3g7Jv)”(interview starts 12:41) because they themselves don’t have faith in the idea of democracy. You can have all the [diverse corporate boardrooms](https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/accountable-capitalism) you want, but if working people still can't afford rent and don’t own [the means of production](https://truthout.org/articles/worker-coops-and-left-strategy/), but rather representatives, what's really changed? The focus stays on who gets to sit at the table, not who built the table or why most of us aren't invited.

Conservative liberals, meanwhile, preach their own version of purity: respect for tradition, law and order, and the "free market." They defend property rights and individual responsibility with religious fervor. But whose property are we protecting? And individual responsibility for what, surviving in a system designed to concentrate wealth upward?

Both sides allow for some variety in their ranks, some "[acceptable](https://prospect.org/politics/2025-05-21-democratic-senators-deserve-primary-crypto-bill/)" dissent. You can be a progressive who supports some business-friendly policies, or a conservative who cares about the environment. But try suggesting that maybe the problem isn't which party runs things, but the fact that neither party represents working people's actual interests, and suddenly you're outside the bounds of respectable opinion.

### The Theater of Opposition

Here's the uncomfortable truth: despite all the shouting and name-calling, Democrats and Republicans [agree](https://image.pivotalventures.org/-/media/Files/PivotalVentures2/Caregiving/PV_CaregivingSurvey_Deck) [on](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2020/09/29/increasing-share-of-americans-favor-a-single-government-program-to-provide-health-care-coverage/) [the](https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/the-green-new-deal-has-strong-bipartisan-support/#:~:text=The%20survey%20results%20show%20overwhelming,of%20the%20Green%20New%20Deal.) [things](https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2025/3/5/voters-think-unions-improve-workers-benefits-and-wages-support-union-neutrality-agreements) that matter most to their real constituents, the wealthy donors who fund their campaigns. They might argue about cultural issues or government spending details, but when it comes to maintaining the basic structure that keeps wealth flowing upward, they're remarkably united.

Think about it. Both parties supported bank [bailouts](https://www.politico.com/story/2008/10/senate-passes-bailout-bill-014190) when Wall Street crashed the economy. Both fund endless military interventions(cough cough Gaza). Both maintain a system where corporations can buy political influence legally. They disagree loudly about the details, which groups deserve protection, how much regulation is too much, whether taxes should go up or down by a few percentage points, but they never question the [fundamental setup.](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68duqMH9JtCt1VQR1GD4jn?si=f3cRjJ2yTAmh-6TVvyQeug)

This creates what we might call "controlled opposition", the illusion that we have real choices when we're actually choosing between two different management styles for the same basic system. It's like being offered the choice between Coke and Pepsi when what you really need is clean water.

### The Propaganda of False Choices

The constant binary thinking, us versus them, left versus right, serves a specific purpose. It keeps working people divided and focused on fighting each other instead of questioning why we're all struggling while a tiny elite accumulates unprecedented wealth.

This isn't accidental. When people start asking inconvenient questions about class and power, the system has well-tested responses. Challenge military spending? You're unpatriotic. Question corporate power? You're anti-business. Suggest that maybe [both](https://www.peoplesworld.org/article/third-way-corporate-centrists-advice-to-democrats-become-republicans/) parties serve the [same](https://www.semafor.com/article/06/04/2025/at-welcomefest-centrist-democrats-pick-a-fight-with-the-left) [wealthy interests](https://therevolvingdoorproject.org/welcomefest/)? You must be a conspiracy theorist, or worse, you're helping the "other side."

These labels aren't applied based on what you actually believe or what evidence you present. They're applied based on whether your ideas threaten the comfortable arrangement where those who own the most also control the most.

### The Real Antagonism

While we're busy arguing about whether we're too "woke" or not "woke" enough, too conservative or not conservative enough, the real conflict continues quietly in the background. It's not between Democrats and Republicans, progressives and conservatives, or any of the other culture war divisions we're fed daily.

The real conflict is between those who own and control the resources society needs to function, the land, the factories, the technology, the financial system, and those who have to work for wages to survive. It's between those who make decisions about how society is organized and those who live with the consequences of those decisions.

Everything else, the identity politics, the cultural battles, the endless debates about individual politicians' personalities, these are distractions from this central reality. Not unimportant distractions, necessarily, but distractions nonetheless.

### Breaking Free from False Consciousness

The tragedy is that working people of all backgrounds, regardless of race, religion, or region, actually share common interests. We all need decent wages, affordable housing, accessible healthcare, and communities that aren't falling apart. We all want our children to have better opportunities than we did. We all want to live with dignity and security.

But instead of organizing around these shared material interests, we're taught to see each other as enemies based on our political identities. White working-class Trump voters and Black working-class Biden voters have more in common with each other than either group has with the wealthy elites in their preferred parties. But admitting this would threaten the system that keeps those elites in power.

### Moving Beyond the Binary

Breaking out of this trap requires recognizing that the problem isn't finding the "right" position within the existing debate. The problem lies in the debate itself, specifically in how it's framed, who is allowed to participate, and what topics are deemed off-limits.

Instead of asking whether we should be more progressive or more conservative, we might ask: Why do people work full-time but still can't afford basic necessities? Why do we have more empty houses than homeless people? Why do a few hundred families control more wealth than half the population combined? And who actually stands against the idea of [democracy](https://jacobin.com/2018/07/democratic-socialism-democracy-ocasio-cortez) 

These aren't "left" or "right" questions, they're human questions. And they can't be answered within the narrow confines of acceptable political discourse, because that discourse is designed to avoid them.

### The Path Forward

Real change won't come from perfecting our position within the existing binary, or from finding the perfect candidate who says all the right things. It will come from working people recognizing their common interests across the artificial divisions that have been created to separate them.  
This means building power outside the traditional political system, in workplaces, neighborhoods, and communities. It means focusing on concrete material improvements in people's lives rather than abstract ideological battles. And it means refusing to be intimidated by labels designed to shut down honest conversation about who really runs this society and in whose interests. It overall, about expanding democracy [everywhere](https://dsanwa.org/democratize-everything/) 

The next time someone tries to end a discussion by calling you a name, whether it's "liberal," "fascist," "communist," or anything else, consider it a sign that you might be asking exactly the right questions. Because the one thing those in power fear most is working people who refuse to fight each other and start asking why the system works the way it does. The real fight isn't between left and right. It's between those who benefit from things staying exactly as they are, and everyone else who deserves something better.
