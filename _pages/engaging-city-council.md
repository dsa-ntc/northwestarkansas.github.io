### **Working to impact the City Council’s decisions is easy and effective\!**

As socialists, we recognize the massive importance of local government for its direct effects on our everyday lives.  Across the United States, cities have become islands of [progressive possibility](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-05/progressives-score-election-wins-in-u-s-cities). The sanctuary cities movement has compelled municipal governments to [aid](https://localprogress.org/2025/02/26/how-local-leaders-are-protecting-communities-under-trump/) and shelter immigrants and refugees. The climate movement has won municipal pledges to adhere to emissions reduction targets and pass [Green New Deal](https://www.cambridgegnd.org/home) legislation. In many cases, the labor movement’s Fight for $15 minimum wage increases and other new protections for workers at the [municipal level](https://www.epi.org/publication/the-role-of-local-government-in-protecting-workers-rights-a-comprehensive-overview-of-the-ways-that-cities-counties-and-other-localities-are-taking-action-on-behalf-of-working-people/#epi-toc-7). And Renters are turning cities into laboratories for new [renter](https://stateline.org/2025/03/28/cities-lead-bans-on-algorithmic-rent-hikes-as-states-lag-behind/) [protection](https://nlihc.org/resource/st-louis-enacts-right-counsel-becoming-second-city-missouri-pass-rtc-ordinance) laws. All of this is because people decided to take that first step in engaging with both their community and local government. NWA DSA wants to empower voters to be more engaged, so here’s how to get started when it comes to your municipal government.  

There are two main ways to engage the City Council:

* Speak at a City Council meeting  
* Email or write a letter to the Council

Civic engagement isn’t something that is built into our everyday culture. It’s easy to see news about big issues like climate change, our immigrant communities being target, and the rent being to damn high, it’s easy to think that it’s out of our hands—that there’s no way we can affect change. BUT:

***When we act collectively on a local level, we can make a huge impact*.** That includes engaging our local officials\! Look no further than the FY2024 Fayetteville [Economic Vitality Master Plan](https://www.fayetteville-ar.gov/DocumentCenter/View/35522/2024-Economic-Vitality-Master-Plan): At first, you would think this is a typical city plan that’s trying to create an economy that is “sustainable”. However, there’s nothing sustainable about enforcing the overuse and failure of the “**Entrepreneurship Economy**.” There’s nothing sustainable about reinforcing the idea that to be successful, you must become a boss yourself, to exploit others’ labor for the *possibility* of being successful. 

It can be nerve-wracking to speak at City Council or even write them a letter. We all go through this\! **The more you do it, the easier it gets.**

And remember: **You don’t have to be an “expert” and your statements don’t have to be earth-shattering.** The fact is, the City Council hears from most of the same people over and over again. While constant engagement is good and necessary, **new voices and perspectives are a breath of fresh air.**

### **What if I reside in the County?**

**Your voice is still important\!** Counties work collectively with cities. While you can speak at Washington County Quorum Court meetings (the city council version of county government), **we recommend engaging with your local City Council also** because county services are interconnected with cities.

If you reside in the County, think about framing your comments in regards to how you interact with the City: “I am a resident of the County, but…”

* … I rely on commuting to this city.”  
* … I used to live in the City until I was forced to move due to housing costs.”  
* … I live right outside of City limits.”  
* … I come into the City multiple times a week.”

### **Councilor Contact Info**

We recommend both emailing the Council and speaking to them directly at meetings\!

**Advantage of email:** You will get a response\! Sometimes the response might be multiple paragraphs long; other times, you may get a simple acknowledgement of receipt.

**Disadvantage of email:** Your voice is only heard by the Council member and not the public at large.

**Advantage of a Phone call:** You’re making direct contact with your representative. Sometimes your response will be one of shock because council members are not used to constituents directly calling, and **THAT’S OK** It’s their job to listen to the needs of their constituents. 

**Disadvantage a Phone call:** There is also a chance of you be left on voicemail, and if that’s the case, it’s always ok to leave a message and try calling later. 

#### **How to make public comments at City Council meetings:**

You can attend a City Council meeting **in person** OR [**online via Zoom**](https://www.fayetteville-ar.gov/3949/Zoom-Meeting-Instructions).

* Find all of the upcoming City meetings listed [here](https://www.fayetteville-ar.gov/calendar.aspx). Click “more details” to find a link to download meeting agendas.

To have a chance to speak, the city council will allow public comment, and when the opportunity arises, you stand up and line up towards the speaking podium.

* The Council will ask if there’s anyone who would like to make comments about what’s on the Consent Agenda. If what you want to talk about is on the Consent Agenda, it’s OK to speak\!  
  * If virtual, you will be prompted to press the “Raise Hand” icon in Zoom to get in line.

**Advantage of speaking:** You will engage the Council directly, and the public at large will be able to consider your opinions.

**Disadvantage of speaking:** The Council does not respond to public comments that are made during meetings.

#### **Physical mailing address:**

Fayetteville City Hall  
113 West Mountain Street

Fayetteville, AR 72701

**Advantage of snail mail:** Council doesn’t get many letters.

**Disadvantages of snail mail:** You won’t get any acknowledgement of receipt, your voice won’t be heard at large, and if speaking on an urgent issue, there’s no guarantee that your letter will reach them in a timely manner. But organizing a letter drive could make the difference; power in numbers always gets the attention by those with power.
