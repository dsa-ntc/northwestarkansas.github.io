[![Want to get involved with Northwest Arkansas DSA? Join us!](assets/images/DSA/dsa-gif-logo.gif)](https://act.dsausa.org/donate/membership/)

<h2>Join DSA!</h2>

The [Democratic Socialists of America](https://www.dsausa.org/) is the largest socialist organization in the United States because weâ€™re a member-driven mass organization. We are a political and activist organization, not a party. We believe that working people should run both the economy and civil society, and we show our commitment to this principle by being an organization of, by, and for the working class.

When you [join DSA](https://www.dsausa.org/join), Northwest Arkansas DSA's Membership co-chairs will reach out to connect you to our local organizing work.

<h3>Chapter Meetings</h3>

Our monthly chapter meetings are key to coordinating our organizing efforts. We host presentations on socialist topics, hold democratic discussions (and vote!) on chapter priorities, and always share updates from our respective working groups.

<h3>Working Groups</h3>

Many of our working groups can be found under [working groups](../working-groups/). This is basic information for each of our working groups to better understand our current campaigns on issues that affect us all!

<h4>Gaza Solidarity</h4>
In Gaza, the Palestinian people have been oppressed for years. A renewed genocide is being conducted by Israel with the support of the United States.

<h4>Electoral</h4>
The electoral working group continues to spread awareness about the election process in the United States. While also engaging with members and prospective members on the workings of DSA.
