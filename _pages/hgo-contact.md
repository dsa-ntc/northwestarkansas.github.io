### Harassement and Grievance Officers

Our harassement and grievance officers (or *HGOs*) receive complaints and guide conflict resolution in accordance with DSA's national policies.

Our HGOs are currently *Danielle* and *Curt*

Here's the [DSA HGO FAQ page](https://www.dsausa.org/resources/harassment-and-grievance/harassment-and-grievance-faq/) and a link to DSA's [Harassement Policy (also known as *Resolution 33*)](https://www.dsausa.org/about-us/harassment-policy-resolution-33/)

Contact our HGOs to submit a complaint through the HGO email: [NWADemSoc.HGO@gmail.com](mailto:NWADemSoc.HGO@gmail.com)
