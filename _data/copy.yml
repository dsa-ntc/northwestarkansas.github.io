  - about: "<b>We are the Northwest Arkansas chapter of Democratic Socialists of America (DSA).</b> Our goal is to help each other and create a society that is more fair and equal than what we see today. Democratic Socialists want to focus their help to those in need and heed the call for peace around the world. Capitalism is a system designed by the owning class to exploit the rest of us for their own profit. We must replace it with democratic socialism, a system where ordinary people have a real voice in our workplaces, neighborhoods, and society."
